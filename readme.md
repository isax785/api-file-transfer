# APIs File Transfer with PyQt5

This is a playground repo aimed at providing a few ways to transfer files and contents between a client and a server.

Main specs:

- Client: gui implemented in `PyQt5` using `requests` library for the API calls;
- Server: a `flask` server implementing RESTful APIs.

The application is under development, soon it will be completed!
